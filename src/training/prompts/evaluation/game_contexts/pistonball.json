  "game_context": "## Game Context for the Global Critic\n\nThis environment is a cooperative piston-based control task known as **Pistonball**, in which multiple pistons act jointly to move a ball toward a shared objective. The system consists of **N pistons** arranged horizontally, all of which share a single **global reward signal**.\n\n---\n\n## Global Objective\n\nThe collective goal of the system is to push the ball to the **LEFT boundary** of the environment (**x = 0**).\n\n- When the ball reaches the left boundary, the episode terminates successfully.\n- All pistons receive the same reward.\n- There are no individual or competitive rewards.\n- Performance is evaluated purely at the **team level**.\n\n---\n\n## Environment Dynamics\n\n- Each piston can move **only in the vertical direction**.\n- Vertical motion indirectly influences the **horizontal movement** of the ball:\n  - Pistons to the **left of the ball** pushing up, together with pistons to the **right of the ball** retracting downward, help form an **inclined surface** that pushes the ball leftward.\n- Effective ball movement requires **spatial and temporal coordination** among neighboring pistons to maintain a smooth, **left-sloping surface**.\n- Pistons that the ball has not yet reached should:\n  - Retract downward\n  - Remain at the lowest position\n  - Avoid unnecessary interference \n - Please note that the ball has a radius of **70 pixels**. Therefore, any piston within **70 px** of the ball is located **under the ball**, and the relevant distance should be interpreted **relative to the ball’s center**, not its surface.\n\n---\n\n## Observability Structure\n\n- Individual agents receive only **local observations**.\n- The **global critic** has access to the **joint state** and evaluates coordination quality across all pistons.\n\nFrom a system-level perspective, relevant information includes:\n- The vertical configuration (height profile) of all pistons\n- The global position and motion of the ball\n\n---\n\n## Action Space\n\nAt each timestep, every piston selects **exactly one discrete action**:\n\n- `0` = **RETRACT_DOWN**\n- `1` = **STAY**\n- `2` = **PUSH_UP**\n\n---\n\n## Coordination Principle (Optimal Policy Summary)\n\nFrom a global perspective, optimal behavior follows these principles:\n\n### When the ball is visible to local agents:\n- Pistons to the **left of the ball** (smaller x) should **retract downward**.\n- Pistons to the **right of the ball** (larger x) should **push upward**.\n- Together, they form a sloped surface that supports the ball’s leftward motion.\n\n### When the ball is not locally visible:\n- Pistons should **retract downward** and remain at the lowest position.\n- This prepares them for future coordinated pushing once the ball enters their field of view.\n\n---\n\n## Credit Assignment Evaluation\n\nYou are evaluating each individual piston’s contribution to team success in **Pistonball**, a cooperative multi-agent control task.\n\n- There are **10 pistons** in total.\n- Each piston must be evaluated **individually**.\n\n---\n\n## Action Space Reminder\n\n- Actions are discrete.\n- Each piston selects exactly one action per timestep:\n  - `0` = **RETRACT_DOWN**\n  - `1` = **STAY**\n  - `2` = **PUSH_UP**\n- Pistons can only move **vertically**.\n- Vertical actions indirectly influence the ball’s **horizontal (leftward)** movement.\n\n---\n\n## Global Objective Reminder\n\n- All pistons share a **single global reward**.\n- The team succeeds by pushing the ball to the **LEFT boundary (x = 0)**.\n- Credit assignment should reflect how each piston contributed to **coordinated leftward motion**."
