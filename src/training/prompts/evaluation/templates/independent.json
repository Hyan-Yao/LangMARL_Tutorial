How well did this piston group execute their role?\n2. What specific actions (with their magnitudes) helped or hindered the team?\n3. What improvements should be made to the policy?\n\nProvide constructive feedback that can be used to improve the piston group's policy. Focus on:\n- Timing of movements relative to ball position\n- Appropriateness of action magnitudes (were actions too extreme or too subtle?)\n- Coordination patterns with adjacent pistons\n- Consistency in executing the intended strategy\n- Specific action values that were effective (e.g., \"using 0.5 for smooth upward movement\") or ineffective (e.g., \"-1.0 was too aggressive, causing ball to bounce away\")"
