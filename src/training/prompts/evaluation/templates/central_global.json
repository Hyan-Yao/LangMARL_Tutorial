  "template": "## GLOBAL TEAM EVALUATION\n\nYou are evaluating the **overall team-level performance** in a cooperative Pistonball environment.\n\n{role_context}\n\n### TASK OBJECTIVE (TEAM LEVEL)\nThe shared objective is to **coordinate all pistons to push the ball to the LEFT boundary (x = 0)**. \nAll pistons receive the same global reward, and success or failure is evaluated **purely at the team level**, not per agent.\n\n### ACTION SPACE REMINDER (DISCRETE)\nAt each timestep, every piston selects exactly one action:\n- `0 = RETRACT_DOWN`\n- `1 = STAY`\n- `2 = PUSH_UP`\n\nPistons can only move vertically. Horizontal ball motion emerges from **collective vertical coordination**.\n\n### TRAJECTORY\n{trajectory}\n\n### EVALUATION TASK\nAssess the **overall effectiveness of team coordination** in accomplishing the global objective. Focus exclusively on system-level behavior.\n\nAnalyze and provide feedback on:\n\n1. **Goal Progress**\n   - Did the team consistently generate leftward ball motion?\n   - Was progress toward the left boundary sustained, stalled, or reversed over time?\n\n2. **Global Coordination Quality**\n   - Did the pistons collectively form and maintain a smooth, left-sloping surface?\n   - Were vertical height transitions across neighboring pistons coherent at the system level?\n\n3. **Action Pattern Coherence**\n   - Were PUSH_UP, STAY, and RETRACT_DOWN actions deployed in a globally consistent manner relative to the ball position?\n   - Did the team avoid large-scale oscillations, conflicting pushes, or chaotic patterns?\n\n4. **Strategic Alignment with Environment Dynamics**\n   - When the ball was engaged, did the team behavior align with effective leftward transport principles?\n   - When the ball was not influencing most pistons, did the team avoid unnecessary or speculative actions?\n\n5. **Systemic Failure Modes (if any)**\n   - Identify any team-wide coordination breakdowns (e.g., excessive pushing, insufficient support, poor surface continuity).\n   - Focus on patterns that emerge across many pistons or over time, not isolated actions.\n\n### FEEDBACK GUIDELINES\nYour feedback should:\n- Address **only the collective behavior of the team**\n- Emphasize coordination patterns, not individual agent mistakes\n- Describe how global action distributions and timing affected ball motion\n- Suggest **team-wide strategic adjustments** that would improve success probability\n\nDo NOT:\n- Assign blame to specific pistons\n- Evaluate agents independently\n- Discuss learning signals or rewards at the individual level\n\nThe goal is to improve the **shared team policy** through clearer global coordination."
